## Trailmaps

Ever tried to plan a long distance hike or bike ride on some of WA's long trails? I have, and it used to be a pain. 
Now you can view an interactive map, calculate distance and elevation and see points of interest

## How do I see it?
- [trailmaps.site](trailmaps.site) for the main URL
- The [Munda Biddi](trailmaps.site/maps/mundabiddi) is the most viewed map

## Technical Stuff
- React, Redux and Typescript on the front with Mapbox
- Serverless Postgres for the DB and Django/DRF running on an Lambda (look it seemed like a good idea at the time okay)
- Cypress for testing and CircleCI CI/CD

## Weird Flex but Okay
- This costs me like $2 a month to run a staging and prod environment
- Google Analytics tells me there were 300 visitors last month
